# Storyscript Examples

This respository contains a collection of Storyscript examples.

Storyscript is an inherently asyncronous (and multi-host) runtime environment. All of these examples, if the code was built out to support them, would automatically run concurrently.

**Note**: Some of the services referenced here (e.g. `machinebox/facebox`) have not been built out, yet.

## Examples

Please see our [`examples` directory](https://github.com/storyscript/examples/tree/master/examples) for some example interactions, using Storyscript.


## Apps

Also, see the [`apps` directory](https://github.com/storyscript/examples/tree/master/apps) for some example Storyscript applications.
