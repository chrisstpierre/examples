# Storyscript Examples

This respository contains a collection of Storyscript examples.

Storyscript is an inherently asyncronous (and multi-host) runtime environment. All of these examples, if the code was built out to support them, would automatically run concurrently.

**Note**: Some of the services referenced here (e.g. `machinebox/facebox`) have not been built out, yet.


## Use Cases

Please see our [`use-cases.story` file](https://github.com/storyscript/examples/blob/master/use-cases.story) for some example interactions, using Storyscript.

## Examples

Also available, in our [`examples` directory](https://github.com/storyscript/examples/tree/master/examples) are more example interactions, using Storyscript.
